Two-thirds are cost-of-care data from Medicare and Medicaid and the remaining costs include out-of-pocket costs by the patient and their families or other payment sources such as private insurance, and uncompensated care.  https://www.ajmc.com/view/the-economic-and-societal-burden-of-alzheimer-disease-managed-care-considerations \n",

Preclinical Alzheimer's disease are usually identified only in research settings. This stage could last for years, but no one would notice any symptoms during this stage. People with mild cognitive impairment have mild changes in their memory and thinking ability. They have trouble judgining amount of time needed for a task or ability to make good decisions. Alzheimer's disease often is diagnosed in the mild dementia stage. The symptoms affect daily functioning such as memory loss of recent events, trouble with problem-solving, changes in personality, getting lost or misplacing belongings. People grow more confused and forgetful during the moderate dementia stage. They show increasingly poor judgement and experience even greater memory loss. It is more severe than mild dementia. In the last stage of the disease, mental function continues to decline. People generally lose the ability to communicate and require daily assistance with personal care.\n",

As Alzheimer’s progresses, it spreads to other cortical regions, leading to loss of language, reasoning, and behavior control. Neurons lose their ability to communicate, metabolize, and repair themselves. Eventually, these neurons die, causing brain shrinkage (atrophy), especially in memory-related areas.\n",

The first, UpdatedLuminex.csv, includes measurements of Alzheimer’s-related proteins (Aβ40, Aβ42, total tau, and phosphorylated tau) taken from brain tissue using Luminex multiplex immunoassays, reported in picograms per microgram of protein. The second, UpdatedMetaData.csv, provides background information on the same 84 donors, such as age, sex, APOE genotype, diagnosis, and standardized pathology scores (Braak, Thal, CERAD), as well as cognitive test results and post-mortem tissue quality measures. Clinical and cognitive data were collected during life, while genetic and pathology measures came from DNA testing and post-mortem analysis. Together, these files make it possible to study how protein biomarkers relate to both symptoms and brain changes in Alzheimer’s disease.\n",

    "\n",
    "Thought proccess for the 6 questions: \n",
    "1) When comparing the data set based on differences in race/ethnicity, are there certain demographics that are more prone to Alzheimers disease? and at what age? How do their CERAD scores differ? \n",
    "2) Does having a past record of playing contact sports, especially that can cause head injury such as football and soccer, increase the progression of the symptoms of Alzheimers disease? Does this progression show a difference in their neuroimaging? \n",
    "3) Does having mental disorders such as anxiety and depression throughout the patients life previous to the diagnosis of Alzheimers corrolate to the progression of Alzheimers disease symtoms at a certain age? How do their Braak scores compare? \n",
    "4) Does having certain genetic factors such as the APOE Genotype affect the pH of the brain, therefore leading to a more progressive affect of the disease? \n",
    "5) To what extent does gender and hormonal level affect the build up of tau in the brain?\n",
    "Overall--> Decided to go with question #2 because we are interested in the corrolation between alzheimers and record of head injury. Through research, we will figure out what tests are used on Alzheimers patients to analyze the effect of head injury in their past, and if this lead to progressive Alzheimers/more severe. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our groups roles: \n",
    "Grace --> Will focus on the code, understanding how to manipulate it and creating different graphs\n",
    "Stella --> Understanding the data we are given and then doing other research on it. Understanding the graphs created and writing the notebooks on our progress. She will note trends in the graphs and in the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Class #2/#3: \n",
    "During these classes we are working on manipulating the code in order to create our own scatter plot that will give us information on specific patients that will help lead us to answering our over-arching question. \n",
    "We had trouble with the code and ultimately created a couple different graphs. Since our question is based off of head injury, which only has two possible varibles: has head injury and doesn't have record of head injury, running a scatter plot is difficult. \n",
    "Because of this, we created two bar graphs. \n",
    "1) The first one was just comparing TAU build up vs. Sex (male vs. female), we created this to test our code and incorperate the effect of gender on our data considering men and females suffer through different amounts of head injury on record. \n",
    "2) The second bar graph we created compared record of head injury vs. MMSE score. Through research we found that the MMSE score is a good test to compare to record of head injury, considering a bad MMSE score indicates \"An MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) score is a number between 0 and 30 indicating cognitive function, with higher scores generally meaning better cognition. A score of 25 or higher is considered normal cognition, while scores between 21-24 often indicate mild impairment, 10-20 suggest moderate impairment, and scores under 10 signal severe impairment\" (https://muhc.ca/sites/default/files/micro/m-PT-OT/OT/Mini-Mental-State-Exam-(MMSE).pdf) \n",
    "This graph showed abnormal results\n",
    "3) We then decided that we should make a scatter plot as well. On this graph, we compared MMSE score to age of diagnosed dementia. We created this graph because it will help us understand if this MMSE score is affected by age and progression of dementia. This will help us answer our question because we can then analyze the corrolation between head injury record and age of diagnosed dementia, assuming those with record of head injury were diagnosed with dementia earlier than those without head injiury. \n",
